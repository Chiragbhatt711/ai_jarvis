Backend Setup (Python FastAPI)
1. Create project directory and navigate to backend
bash
mkdir jarvis-assistant
cd jarvis-assistant
mkdir backend
cd backend
2. Create virtual environment
bash
python -m venv jarvis_env
3. Activate virtual environment
Windows:

bash
jarvis_env\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:

bash
source jarvis_env/bin/activate
4. Install dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If you encounter issues with pyaudio installation:

Windows: You might need to install it from a wheel file
macOS: Run brew install portaudio first
Linux: Run sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
5. Run the backend server
bash
python main.py
The backend will be running at: http://localhost:8000 API documentation available at: http://localhost:8000/docs

Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to project root and create frontend
bash
cd ..  # Go back to jarvis-assistant directory
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
2. Replace the generated files
Replace src/App.js with the provided React code
Replace src/App.css with the provided CSS code
Update package.json with the provided configuration
3. Install additional dependencies (if needed)
bash
npm install
4. Start the React development server
bash
npm start
The frontend will be running at: http://localhost:3000

Features and Commands
Voice Commands
Click the microphone button to start voice input
Speak your command clearly
The system will automatically process your speech
Text Commands
You can type or speak these commands:

"Open YouTube" - Opens YouTube in browser
"Open Google" - Opens Google in browser
"Open Chrome" - Opens Chrome browser
"Open Calculator" - Opens system calculator
"Open Notepad" - Opens text editor
"What time is it?" - Shows current time
"What's today's date?" - Shows current date
"Search for [query]" - Searches Google for the query
"System information" - Shows system details
Quick Command Buttons
The interface includes quick command buttons for common tasks.

Configuration
Backend Configuration
Port: Default is 8000, can be changed in main.py
CORS: Currently allows requests from http://localhost:3000
TTS Settings: Speech rate and volume can be adjusted in the JarvisCore.__init__() method
Frontend Configuration
API URL: Currently set to http://localhost:8000
Speech Recognition: Uses browser's built-in Web Speech API
Styling: Modern glassmorphism design with responsive layout
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. Backend won't start:

Ensure all dependencies are installed
Check if port 8000 is available
Try running with: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
2. Speech recognition not working:

Ensure you're using Chrome or Edge (best support)
Check microphone permissions
Ensure HTTPS (for production) or localhost (for development)
3. TTS not working:

Check if pyttsx3 is properly installed
On Linux, you might need: sudo apt-get install espeak
4. Applications won't open:

Commands are system-specific
Ensure the applications exist on your system
Check system permissions
Development Tips
1. Adding new commands:

Add command logic to JarvisCore.process_command() method
Update the command recognition patterns
Add corresponding quick command buttons in React
2. Customizing the UI:

Modify App.css for styling changes
Update App.js for functionality changes
Colors and animations can be easily customized
3. Adding more features:

Web scraping: Add beautifulsoup4 to requirements
More AI features: Integrate with OpenAI API
Database: Add sqlalchemy for data persistence
Security Notes
This is a development setup - don't expose to public internet without proper security
Add authentication for production use
Validate all user inputs properly
Consider sandboxing system commands
Next Steps
Add more voice commands
Integrate with external APIs (weather, news, etc.)
Add user authentication
Create mobile app version
Add machine learning capabilities
Enjoy your AI Jarvis assistant! ðŸ¤–
